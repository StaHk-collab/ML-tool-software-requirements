# ml-tool-for-software-requirements

Requirements are descriptions of how a system should behave. The quality of the requirements determines the overall quality of the software product. The various phases involved in software development are requirements, design, coding, testing, deploying. According to past research, around 60% of all errors in software development projects initiate during the requirements engineering phase. A major cause of poor quality requirements is that the stakeholders involved in the development phase have different interpretations of technical terms, and that is due to the ambiguity present in the natural language text.
For example, the word cookie in context of computer science (CS) means a small amount of data stored on userâ€™s machine by the web browser while it is a sweet biscuit for a food engineer. Similarly, the word table in context of computer science (CS) means a grid of rows and columns while it may also mean a furniture in different context.

This project focuses on extraction of text from requirements documents. Since 99% of all the relevant terms are noun phrases, we only focus on extracting them. We will be using neural word embedding technique for detecting the domain-specific technical terms from two different corpora (in PDF format). We will be using pre-trained Word2Vec model and FastText Python library, by the Facebook Research Team, for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification.
